## [0.0.1] 2025-03-02 - Gameplay Enhancements and Asset Optimization
### 🔥 Features
- Implemented `FireBoyAndWaterGirlGame` core logic.
- Added `MainMenu` overlay system with `overlayBuilderMap`.
- Created a `main_menu.dart` file for handling UI interactions.
- Implemented `CharacterAnimation` class for movement and collision handling.
- Added new `finishLevel()` method for player animation control.

### 🎮 Gameplay Improvements
- Stopped movement when a level is finished using `stopMoving` boolean.
- Added player position reset upon level completion.
- Implemented `onKeyEvent` handling logic to prevent movement when `stopMoving` is enabled.

### 📦 Asset Management
- Updated sound effects (`button_click.mp3`, `button_hover.mp3`, `fan.mp3`) to normalize audio levels.
- Added a new custom font (`custom_font.TTF`) for UI text.
- Optimized `large_acid_pool.png`, `large_lava_pool.png`, and `large_water_pool.png` assets.

### 🛠️ Code Refactoring
- Reorganized `import` statements for better structure.
- Changed file references to use enums instead of hardcoded asset paths.
- Applied `HitboxType` to dynamically load sprites in `acid_pool_hitbox.dart` and `lava_pool_hitbox.dart`.
- Optimized `AudioManager` to support `Future<void>` for async audio playback.
- Updated `audio_type.dart` to include a new `levelComplete` sound.

### 🏗️ Level Design
- Updated `level_1.dart` to include:
  - New door and platform logic.
  - Collision handling for Fireboy and Watergirl.
  - Sound effect for level completion.
  - Zoom-in camera effect when a level is completed.

### 🏆 Game Mechanics

  - Lava pools (`lava_pool_hitbox.dart`).
  - Water pools (`water_pool_hitbox.dart`).
  - Diamonds (`diamond_hitbox.dart`).

### 🔧 Debugging Enhancements
- Added `kDebugMode` check to prevent debug hitboxes from rendering in production.

- Adjusted platform and character positioning for better gameplay flow.

### 🛠️ Dependency Updates
- Added `gap: 3.0.1` to `pubspec.lock`.
